## Requirements
* Device = `PIXEL 2 API 26`
* Emulator version = `31.3.13`
* Before executing the app, please set a location for the emulator in `extended controls`. When clicking that button, it should open a new window and default at "Location" session. Choose a location to represent the current location since emulator does not have a GPS to find the current location.
